# hello-world
My second repository on GitHub.
I am excited about this bootcamp.
I am currently employed with the U. S. Air Force as a civilian.
I have two children (boys), ages 35 and 32.
I live in Zebulon, North Carolina.
It has been challenging trying to get this to work
I was very upset because I was not able to complete it with the class.
