# hello-world
This README will explain my repository.
This repo is about Ops 201 and what was learned/accomplished.
I am learning these skills to increase my knowledge in IT and to obtain employment in a new career field.
Some of the fundamental concepts I learned were: how to write script to Ubuntu/Linux, create a VM, enter/review/escalate tickets into a help desk product, restore and repair corrupt and deleted files, and other fun and challenging things.  I cannot list them all.
It will help me to perform the tasks when needed and teach others how to do so as well.  It will also be great knowledge if hired to be at a helpdesk environment.
Bash-gain more of a understanding of the order and meaning of each command and structure of the script lines.
I want to improve on writing and structure, understanding the "lingo" and purpose of each command within a script line.
